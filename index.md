### Quotable Quotes
> It's the questions we can't answer that teach us the most. They teach us how to think. If you give a man an answer, all he gains is a little fact. But give him a question and he'll look for his own answers. ― Patrick Rothfuss, The Wise Man's Fear 

> Half of seeming clever is keeping your mouth shut at the right times. ― Patrick Rothfuss, The Wise Man's Fear 

> A common mistake that people make when trying to design something completely foolproof is to underestimate the ingenuity of complete fools. - Douglas Adams, The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy

> For instance, on the planet Earth, man had always assumed that he was more intelligent than dolphins because he had achieved so much — the wheel, New York, wars and so on — whilst all the dolphins had ever done was muck about in the water having a good time. But conversely, the dolphins had always believed that they were far more intelligent than man — for precisely the same reasons. - Douglas Adams, The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy

> I'm with you 'til the end of the line." - Steven Rogers, Captain America: The Winter Soldier
